This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to null and undefined checks in function parameters. The bug occurs when the function expects parameters to be of specific data types but does not handle the case where they are null or undefined, causing unexpected behavior.  The solution uses the nullish coalescing operator to provide a more concise and robust way to handle null and undefined values and improve code readability.
